Big Data On-Premise vs in the Cloud

- Price of storage and processing has dropped dramatically
- Analysts often get pulled into hardware issues that they aren't equipped for
- Infrastructure can interrupt analytical processing
- Cloud service allows focus on insights and not hardware
- BigQuery is based on Google's in-house infrastructure, allowing outsiders to draw on Google's scale and speed
- Google cloud is based on a huge physical network of infrastructure
- Huge global network of data centers, including edge locations in 30+ countries
- On-demand cloud allows ad hoc querying and scalable storage
- Scalability means avoiding two issues with on-premise: being under- or over-provisioned with data analytical capacity, i.e. making a tradeoff between time and money (lots of machines and quick queries but lots of money vs cheap but slow queries with few resources)
- Google Cloud Platform decouples storage and processing, so you pay for only the resources you use and no more

Real World Use-Cases

- Ocado had issue of huge transactional, logistics, and weather data
- Wanted to be able to query data quickly
- Goal: make data so intelligent it has answers up front
- Spotify wanted to spend less time doing stuff like scaling and dealing with infrastructure, and more time on turning data into value

Navigate Google Cloud Platform Basics

- Umbrella is 'Project'
- Projects organize and govern your activities in the cloud
	- Navigate and launch cloud tools in Products and Services menu
	- Work collaboratively by adding project users with IAM
	- Can authorize tools and apps
- Resources are what you use in the cloud
	- Buckets are scalable containers that hold data
- You are billed for the resources you use
	- Storage in Google Cloud Storage
	- Datasets in Google BigQuery (query processing, table storage)
