**Introduction to MapReduce and Hadoop**

*Hadoop introduction:*

	* Programming framework that supports processing of large datasets in distributed computing environment
	* Run applications on thousands of nodes involving thousands of terabytes
	* Distributed file system supports rapid data transfer rates
	* Lowers risk of catastrophic system failure
	
For:

	Designed for offline process of large-scale data
	Best used as write once and read many type of data store
	
Not for

	Random reading and writing of few records
	Online transaction processing (OLTP) applications

Hadoop Architecture

	MapReduce: parallel processing framework, massively scaleable, works in tandem with HDFS
	HDFS: distributed file storage
	Difference from traditional systems: computation executed at location of data, meaning no need to move from storage to compute and thus rely on network bandwidth
	
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):

	Master and slave node architecture
	Clusters consist of single NameNode, secondary NameNode and multiple DataNodes
	Stores each file as sequence of blocks; blocks are same size except for last block; block size and replication factor are configurable
	
Details on HDFS

		NameNode: Master, maintains name system of directories/files, manages DataNode blocks
		DataNode: Slaves where data stored; serve read/write requests; perform block creation, deletion, replication
		Secondary NameNode: Helper node for NameNode; communicates to take snapshots of HDFS metadata; can restart NameNode with checkpoint; run on a different computer from primary NameNode
		
Details on MapReduce

		JobTracker: Master of system; schedules each map as close as possible to actual data being processed
		TaskTracker: Slaves deployed on each machine; responsible for running map and reduce tasks
		
Hadoop 2.x - Architecture (YARN)

	HDFS snapshots
	NFSv3 access to data in HDFS
	Windows supports
	Binary compatibility for MapReduce on Hadoop 1.0
	Integration testing with other Hadoop ecosystem components
	
YARN = Yet Another Resource Negotiator

Differences between Hadoop 1.0 and Hadoop 2.x

	Federation: Multiple NameNode and Namespaces
	High Availability
	YARN: Resource Manager, Node Manager, Application Master, Capacity Scheduler
	
Hadoop and AWS

	Amazon EMR can run open-source projects for Hadoop
	Amazon EMR integrated with Hive, Pig, Hbase, Ganglia
	Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is a  managed service that makes it easy to install Hadoop application, and manage and run your cluster
	Can use Amazon S3 for storage
	Can manually install Hadoop on Amazon EC2 instances
	
Amazon EMR

	Most performant, reliable, secure way to run Hadoop on AWS
	Tight integration with S3
	Output logs to S3
	Connected to EC2 Spot Market
