**Use Case: Recommendation Engine**

*World's Biggest Job Recommender*

	Membership from few million to 200 million in 8 years
	Millions of company pages
	Millions hired using the service
	
Problem statement:

	Neded recommendation platform
	Terabytes of data: rich and structured data
	Huge semi-structured data; exponential growth
	Goal: get right information to right user at the right time
	Talent matching: Real-time suggestions for top candidates
	
*Key Challenges*

	Huge data flow
	Needs scalable infrastructure to process data
	Relevance is most important consideration
	Latency of recommendations also important
	Need for platform where complex algorithms can be created and implemented
	Profile recommendation involves very complex computations
	
*Solution Proposed*

	People don't reinvent themselves
	Company could serve similar profiles from cache; then compute fresh recommendations and repopulate the cache
	Used Hadoop to generate portion of recommendations in mapper then combine them into final recommendation set in Reducers
	Hadoop: easily generate similar profiles for members; copy results to online caches
	Offline batch computations copied to online caches
	Aggressive online caching policy
	
*Job Recommendations*

	Scaled 'similar profiles' while maintaining high precision
	Helped transform company into leading professional network
