**Pig vs Traditional RDBMSs**

Pig vs SQL

	Pig relation: 
	
		Bag of tuples, may have duplicate tuples
		May have different number of columns
		Columns in same position may have different data types
		
	RDBMS relation:
	
		Every tuple is unique
		Fixed number of columns (when schema is specified)
		Columns in same position have same data type
		
	Pig Latin:
	
		Procedural
		Allows developers to decide where to checkpoint
		Insert code anywhere in the data pipeline
		Supports splits in pipeline and data can be stored at any point in pipeline
		Native ETL
		Lazy evaluation
		No control systems like IF and ELSE
		
	SQL:
	
		Declarative
		Limited to no pipeline support
		Additional ETL tools needed for customization of pipeline
		Splits not supported
		Need ETL tools
		Instant invocation of commands
		Control statements available
