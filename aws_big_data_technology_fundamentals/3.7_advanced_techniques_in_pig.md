**Advanced Techniques in Pig**

Parameter Substitution in Pig

	Basic string-replacement functionality
	Can be used for regular updates to scripts (i.e. for dates)
	Can be passed from command line or from parameter file
	
	stocks.pig
		daily = load 'stocks_daily' as (date:chararray,volume:int,high:float,low:float);
		yesterday = filter daily by date == '$DATE';
		grpd = group yesterday all;
		minmax = foreach grpd generate MAX(yesterday.high), MIN(yesterday.low);
		
	Must provide definition for parameter DATE
	
		pig -p DATE = 2014-05-05 stocks.pig
	
	Can also be placed in file passed as parameter
	
Macros in Pig

	Pig Latin supports macros to make longer scripts more functionality
	You define macros
	Declared with the DEFINE statement; set in same script file or written in different file and imported
	Must appear prior to first used
	Can include references to other macros
	Not a complete replacement for function calls
	Any alias in macro which isn't visible from outside will be prefixed with macro name and suffixed with instance ID
	
Pig Joins

	One of most common data operations
	JOIN: always an inner join
	OUTER JOIN: LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL outer joins
	
	Fragment Replicate Join: 
	
		Special type of join that works if one or more relations can fit into main memory
		Pig can perform very efficient join as work is done on map side
		Large relation followed by one or more small relations; if too large, error is generated
		Loads replicated input into Hadoop distributed cache (MapReduce tool)
		Supports only inner and left joins
		Can be used with more than two tables
