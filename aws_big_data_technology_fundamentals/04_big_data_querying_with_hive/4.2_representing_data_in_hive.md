**Representing Data in Hive**

Hive CLI

	CLI is most common way to interact with Hive
	Used for issuing DDL and metadata exploration commands
	
	Sample queries:
	
	$Hive_Home/bin/Hive -e 'select name from employee'
	$Hive_Home/bin/Hive -S -e 'select name from employee' > name.txt
	
How Hive Data is Organized

	Four categories:
	
	1. Database: Namespaces tha separate tables and other data units
	2. Tables: Homogenous units of data with same schema
	3. Partitions: Determines how data is stored, can include partition columns (virtual)
	4. Buckets: Division of partitions, i.e. page_views table might be bucketed by userid

Hive Database

	A catalog or namespace of tables
	Organizes tables into logical groups
	Schema policy is a difference from traditional database; traditional database follows schema on write policy. Hive database follows schema on read policy. Rules applied on read
	
	Advantages of Hive database:
	
	Can load database into HDFS before deciding what to do with it
	Allows schema to evolve as time goes on (high flexibility)
	Lets you have two different schemas on top of underlying data set
	Creating and managing is easy and similar to SQL
	
	Syntax examples:
	
	Hive> CREATE DATABASE employee
	Hive> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS employee
	
Tables in Hive

	Data typically resides as flat files in HDFS
	Tables are just files stored in HDFS subdirectories
	
	Types of tables:
	
	1. Internal/Managed tables: Managed tables exist in HDFS, Hive controls lifecycle
	2. External tables: Data stored outside Hive, no management, delete actions only delete metadata, useful for data being used by multiple databases

Views in Hive

	Similar to views in relational databases
	Reduces query complexity
	Hive evaluates view and then uses results to evaluate query
	
	View syntax example:
	
	CREATE VIEW ny_graduate_courses AS 
	SELECT *
	FROM uni_courses_all
	JOIN course_list ON (course.id = course.id)
	WHERE state = 'NY'
	
Partitioning tables in Hive

	Partition defines how to physically split data on disk
	Partitions organize the data properly and tell Hive about where and how to best access it
	Partitions function like a dictionary index in Hive, i.e. date, location, etc

Bucketed tables

	Technique to organize data from tables/partitions into multiple parts (i.e. buckets)
	Each record is read and placed into buckets based on logic or algorithm
	Partition = directory, bucket = files
	Bucketing is more efficient for JOIN queries, and for sampling queries
	Bucketing avoids too much data slicing, or the creating of thousands of partitions
	
Indexing in Hive

	Critical for improving efficiency and performance
	Avoids need to re-scan all data to retrieve required rows in query
	Indexed column values and pointer/offset to location of data
	
Hive Metastore

	Centralized repository for Hive metadata
	Composed of Metastore service & backing store
	
	Stores:
	
		Tables
		Partitions
		Schemas
		Columns
		Types
		Table locations
		
	Uses Derby database on local file system to store information
	Can use other RDBMS types, i.e. MySql or PostgreSQL

Storage Type - RCFile, ORCFile, Sequencefile

	RCFile (Record Columnar File): Designed for systems using MapReduce. Fast loading, query processing, efficient space utilization
	ORCFile (Optimized Row Columnar file format): Efficient way to store Hive data. Improves performance when Hive is reading, writing, processing.
	Sequencefile: Flat file of binary key/value pairs. Used in MapReduce as input/output formats. 3 formats: Uncompressed key/value pairs, record compressed key/value records, block compressed key/value records
