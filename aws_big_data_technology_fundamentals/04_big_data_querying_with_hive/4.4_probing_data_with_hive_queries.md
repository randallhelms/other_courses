**Probing Data with Hive Queries**

Loading Data into Hive

	Once table create, next step is to feed data into the table for processing
	Main commands:
	LOAD: Purely copy and move operations
	INSERT
	
	Query results can be inserted into Hive tables using INSERT
	Inserts can be run on table or partition
	On a partition, must identify specific partition
	Multiple insert commands can be specified in same query
	
	Two types of insert:
	
	INSERT OVERWRITE: Overwrites any existing data
	
	INSERT INTO: Append data to table/partition
	
Hive - Select Query

	Similar to SELECT in SQL
	
	Basic structure:
	
		SELECT
		FROM
		WHERE
		GROUP BY
		SORT BY
		ORDER BY / CLUSTER BY / DISTRIBUTE BY
		LIMIT
		
ORDER BY

	All data passed through single reducer, can take long time to finish
	Use LIMIT to restrict number of rows to be scanned
	
SORT BY

	Sorts rows before feeding rows to reducer
	Performs local ordering
	
Hive JOIN

	INNER JOIN - new result table by combining column values of two tables
	OUTER JOIN - Does not require each record in joined tables to have matching record
	Map join is special type of join, requiring join to be done in map phase of MapReduce job (can be much faster)
	
Hive UNION

	UNION is used to combine results from multiple SELECT statements into single result set
	Only UNION ALL supported
	Result of union can be passed as input into another query
	
Sub-queries

	Hive supports two types of subqueries:
		FROM
		WHERE
		
Virtual Columns

	Not part of physical Hive tables
	Used for error diagnosis
	2 types:
		INPUT_FILE_NAME
		BLOCK_OFFSET_INSIDE_FILE
	
	Example:
	
	Select INPUT_FILE_NAME, name FROM ebook_table WHERE name='Einstein';
	
Export and Import Data

	EXPORT and IMPORT commands let users move data between Hive and RDBMS systems
	
Sampling

	Allows you to run queries on smaller set of data
	Trade-off between speed and accuracy
	Common uses: predictive analysis, trend analysis
	
	Two main types:
	
	Sampling bucketized tables
	Block sampling
