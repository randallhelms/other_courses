**Hive Use Case**

Ad Hoc Analysis and Product Feedback

	AgencyX is engaged in project for online supply chain retailer
	Project involves product analysis (determines impact of new features on inventory)
	Ad hoc analysis performed based on user engagement and by measuring click-through rate of particular new feature
	Deeper analysis can look at impact by region, i.e. CTR for North America compared to Asia
	
	Steps:
	
	1. Analyze three years of logs (10TB)
	2. Traditional BI tools become inefficient past 1TB and with unstructured data
	3. BI systems too slow for working with such a large dataset
	4. Quick processing time required
	
Solution using Hive and Hadoop technologies

	Application: Flume collects data and sends it to HDFS storage
	Hive perfoms role of analyzer - scripts and queries run on top of this dataset to produce reports
	Query: Join impressions and clicks for particular link related to feature, also including aggregations and geography. Can all be done in Hive using SQL
	
Analysis using Hive

	AgencyX built their system using a minimal cluster configuration and capacity
	Can run regular activities in a cluster of 50 virtual instances with the following configurations
	
	Analysis results:
	Tremendous insight into year-over-year sales patterns
	Through the analysis, an unexpected seasonal purchase pattern was discovered, which helped the retailer to increase sales
	Reduced infrastructure cost compared to previous solutions
	AgencyX used model to implement similar solutions for other clients
