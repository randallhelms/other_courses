**Pig Data Types**

Identifiers:

	Names of relations (aliases)
	Fields
	Variables
	
	Pig identifiers start with a letter and can be followed by any number of letters, digits and underscores

Simple Data Types

	* Int - 4 byte integers
	* Long - 8 byte integers
	* Float - 4 byte floats
	* Double - 8 byte floats
	* Bytearray - Blob or array of bytes
	* Chararray - String / character array
	
Complex Data Types

	* Data Atom - Single atomic data value, stored as strings
	* Tuple - Sequence of fields, data of any type in an ordered set of values
	* Data Bag - Set of tuples (with duplicates allowed). Denoted with {}
	* Data Map - Set of key/value pairs
	
Pig Memory Management:

	Allocates fixed amount of memory to store bags/spills to disk as soon as memory limit reached
	Amount of memory allocated to bags is determined by pig.cachedbag.memusage
	Waits until memory is low before spilling excess bags to disk
	Maintains list of Pig bags using list of Java WeakReferences
	WeakReferences ensures garbage collection of bags when no longer in use
