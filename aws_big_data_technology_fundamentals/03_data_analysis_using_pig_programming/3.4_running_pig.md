**Running Pig**

Type of Execution:

	Local Mode: Running Pig on only one machine; all files are installed and run using local host and file system (pig -x local)
	MapReduce Mode: Need to have access to running Hadoop cluster and HDFS installation; Pig translates queries into MapReduce jobs and runs them on Hadoop cluster (pig -x mapreduce)
	
Type of Invocation:

	Interactive Mode/Grunt Shell: Enter Pig commands manually; typically run for troubleshooting
	Batch Mode/Script File: Place Pig commands in a script file and run script
	
Batch Mode/Script Mode

	A group of Pig Latin statements can be grouped together to form a Pig Script and can be run together
	Batch mode used for production environments
	Entire script is parsed to determine whether intermediate tasks can be combined to reduce overall amount of work that needs to be done
